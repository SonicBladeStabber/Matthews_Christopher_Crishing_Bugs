# Crishing_Bugs
Assignment Description <br><br>
Use the in-class build files (the Puzzle Drag and Drop) and fix the bugs that were discovered in
class. This is a research assignment - solve the problems outlined in the brief.<br>
Create new branches (named appropriately) and update the functionality to improve
the game UX.<br><br>
Assignment Requirements<br><br>
In its current state, our puzzle game has at least a couple of bugs. You can drag and drop more
than one puzzle piece into a drop zone - this shouldn’t happen. There should only be one piece
in one drop zone at a time.<br>
The second bug is the problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a
new puzzle. Those should be removed / reparented back to the drag zone as well, so that the
player has a fresh board to drop onto.<br>
Solve these two problems. You can use the original drop function to solve the first problem, and
another function for the second. Try experimenting with calling one function from another - you
might not need to add any event handling to solve these issues, just extend the functionality.<br>
Don’t overthink it! When you’re starting down a programming path, the trend is to
overcomplicate the issues. Resist that - break it down into simple steps BEFORE you try writing
code, and then do some research.
